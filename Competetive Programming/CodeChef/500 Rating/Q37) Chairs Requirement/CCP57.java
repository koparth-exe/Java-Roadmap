//Chairs Requirement
//Chef's coding class is very famous in Chefland.
//
//This year
//X
//X students joined his class and each student will require one chair to sit on. Chef already has
//        Y
//Y chairs in his class. Determine the minimum number of new chairs Chef must buy so that every student is able to get one chair to sit on.
//
//        Input Format
//The first line contains a single integer
//        T
//T — the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
//The first and only line of each test case contains two integers
//        X
//X and
//Y
//Y — the number of students in the class and the number of chairs Chef already has.
//Output Format
//For each test case, output the minimum number of extra chairs Chef must buy so that every student gets one chair.

//Sample 1:
//Input
//        Output
//4
//        20 14
//        41 41
//        35 0
//        50 100
//        6
//        0
//        35
//        0
//Explanation:
//Test case 1: There are
//20
//        20 students in the class and Chef has
//14
//        14 chairs already. Therefore Chef must buy
//6
//        6 more chairs.
//Test case 2: There are
//41
//        41 students in the class and Chef already has exactly
//41
//        41 chairs. Therefore Chef does not need to buy any more chairs.
//Test case 3: There are
//35
//        35 students in the class and Chef has no chairs initially. Therefore Chef must buy
//35
//        35 chairs.
