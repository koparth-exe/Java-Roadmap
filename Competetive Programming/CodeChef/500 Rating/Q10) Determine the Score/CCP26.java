//Determine the Score
//Chef appeared for a placement test.
//
//There is a problem worth
//        X
//X points. Chef finds out that the problem has exactly
//10
//        10 test cases. It is known that each test case is worth the same number of points.
//
//        Chef passes
//N
//N test cases among them. Determine the score Chef will get.
//
//NOTE: See sample explanation for more clarity.
//
//Input Format
//First line will contain
//T
//T, number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
//Each test case contains of a single line of input, two integers
//X
//X and
//N
//N, the total points for the problem and the number of test cases which pass for Chef's solution.
//Output Format
//For each test case, output the points scored by Chef.

//Explanation:
//Test Case
//1
//        1: The problem is worth
//10
//        10 points and since there are
//10
//        10 test cases, each test case is worth
//1
//        1 point. Since Chef passes
//3
//        3 test cases, his score will be
//1
//        ⋅
//        3
//        =
//        3
//        1⋅3=3 points.
//
//        Test Case
//2
//        2: The problem is worth
//100
//        100 points and since there are
//10
//        10 test cases, each test case is worth
//10
//        10 points. Since Chef passes all the
//10
//        10 test cases, his score will be
//10
//        ⋅
//        10
//        =
//        100
//        10⋅10=100 points.
//
//        Test Case
//3
//        3: The problem is worth
//130
//        130 points and since there are
//10
//        10 test cases, each test case is worth
//13
//        13 points. Since Chef passes
//4
//        4 test cases, his score will be
//13
//        ⋅
//        4
//        =
//        52
//        13⋅4=52 points.
//
//        Test Case
//4
//        4: The problem is worth
//70
//        70 points and since there are
//10
//        10 test cases, each test case is worth
//7
//        7 points. Since Chef passes
//0
//        0 test cases, his score will be
//7
//        ⋅
//        0
//        =
//        0
//        7⋅0=0 points.
