//IPL Ticket Rush
//DAIICT college students want to attend an IPL match.
//
//A total of
//        N
//N students from the college want to go while only
//        M
//M tickets are available for the match.
//
//Determine how many students won't be able to book tickets.
//
//Input Format
//The first line of input will contain a single integer
//T
//T, denoting the number of test cases.
//Each test case consists of two space-separated integers
//N
//N and
//M
//M — the number of students wants to go and the total number of tickets available, respectively.
//Output Format
//For each test case, output on a new line the number of students who won't be able to book tickets.

//Explanation:
//Test case
//        1
//        1: There are
//5
//        5 students who want to go, and only
//3
//        3 tickets are available. Hence
//2
//        2 students won't be able to get tickets.
//
//Test case
//        2
//        2: There are
//5
//        5 students who want to go, and
//7
//        7 tickets are available. So, every one of them will get the tickets.
//
//Test case
//        3
//        3: There are
//4
//        4 students who want to go, and only
//1
//        1 ticket is available. Hence
//3
//        3 students won't be able to get tickets.
//
//Test case
//        4
//        4: There are
//8
//        8 students who want to go, and
//8
//        8 tickets are available. So, every one of them will get the tickets.
