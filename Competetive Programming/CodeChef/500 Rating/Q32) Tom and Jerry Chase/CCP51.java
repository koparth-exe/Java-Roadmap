//Tom and Jerry Chase
//In a classic chase, Tom is running after Jerry as Jerry has eaten Tom's favourite food.
//
//Jerry is running at a speed of
//        X
//X metres per second while Tom is chasing him at a speed of
//Y
//Y metres per second. Determine whether Tom will be able to catch Jerry.
//
//Note that initially Jerry is not at the same position as Tom.
//
//Input Format
//The first line of input will contain a single integer
//T
//T, denoting the number of test cases.
//Each test case consists of two space-separated integers
//X
//X and
//Y
//Y — the speeds of Jerry and Tom respectively.
//        Output Format
//For each test case, output on a new line, YES, if Tom will be able to catch Jerry. Otherwise, output NO.
//
//You can print each character in uppercase or lowercase. For example NO, no, No, and nO are all considered the same.

//Explanation:
//Test case
//        1
//        1: Jerry is running at the speed of
//2
//        2 metres per second while Tom is chasing him at the speed of
//3
//        3 metres per second. Since Jerry's speed is less than Tom's, Tom will eventually catch Jerry.
//
//        Test case
//        2
//        2: Jerry is running at the speed of
//4
//        4 metres per second while Tom is chasing him at the speed of
//1
//        1 metres per second. Since Jerry's speed is higher than Tom's, Tom will never be able to catch Jerry.
//
//        Test case
//        3
//        3: Jerry is running at the speed of
//1
//        1 metre per second while Tom is chasing him at the speed of
//1
//        1 metre per second. Since Jerry's speed is same as that of Tom's and both of them are not at the same position, Tom will never be able to catch Jerry.
//
//        Test case
//        4
//        4: Jerry is running at the speed of
//3
//        3 metres per second while Tom is chasing him at the speed of
//5
//        5 metres per second. Since Jerry's speed is less than Tom's, Tom will eventually catch Jerry.
