//Parity
//Ashu and Arvind participated in a coding contest, as a result of which they received
//N
//N chocolates. Now they want to divide the chocolates between them equally.
//
//Can you help them by deciding if it is possible for them to divide all the
//        N
//N chocolates in such a way that they each get an equal number of chocolates?
//
//You cannot break a chocolate in two or more pieces.
//
//        Input Format
//The first line of input will contain a single integer
//T
//T, denoting the number of test cases.
//The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer
//N
//N — the number of chocolates they received.
//Output Format
//For each test case output the answer on a new line — "Yes" (without quotes) if they can divide chocolates between them equally, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.
//
//Each letter of the output may be printed in either uppercase or lowercase, i.e, "Yes", "YES", and "yEs" will all be treated as equivalent.

//Explanation:
//Test case
//        1
//        1: They can divide
//10
//        10 chocolates such that both of them get
//5
//        5 chocolates each.
//
//Test case
//        2
//        2: They can divide
//4
//        4 chocolates such that both of them get
//2
//        2 chocolates each.
//
//Test case
//        3
//        3: There is no way to divide
//3
//        3 chocolates so that they get equal number of chocolates.
//
//        Test case
//        4
//        4: They can divide
//2
//        2 chocolates such that both of them get
//1
//        1 chocolate each.
