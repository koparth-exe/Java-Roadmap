//Time Complexity
//A sorting algorithm
//        A
//A is said to have more time complexity than a sorting algorithm
//B
//B if it uses more number of comparisons for sorting the same array than algorithm
//B
//B.
//
//Given that algorithm
//        A
//A uses
//X
//X comparisons to sort an array and algorithm
//B
//B uses
//Y
//Y comparisons to sort the same array, find whether algorithm
//        A
//A has more time complexity.
//
//        Input Format
//The first line of input will contain a single integer
//T
//T, denoting the number of test cases.
//Each test case consists of two space-separated integers
//X
//X and
//Y
//Y — the number of comparisons used by algorithms
//        A
//A and
//B
//B to sort the array respectively.
//Output Format
//For each test case, output on a new line, YES, if the algorithm
//A
//A has more time complexity than
//B
//B and NO otherwise.
//
//You may print each character of the string in uppercase or lowercase (for example, the strings YES, yEs, yes, and yeS will all be treated as identical).

//Explanation:
//Test case
//        1
//        1: The number of comparisons used by algorithm
//        A
//A is
//9
//        9 and that used by
//B
//B is also
//9
//        9. Since the number of comparisons used by
//        A
//A is not more than that of
//        B
//B,
//A
//A does not have more time complexity than
//B
//B.
//
//        Test case
//        2
//        2: The number of comparisons used by algorithm
//        A
//A is
//15
//        15 and that used by
//B
//B is
//7
//        7. Since the number of comparisons used by
//        A
//A is more than that of
//        B
//                B,
//                A
//A does have more time complexity than
//        B
//B.
//
//        Test case
//        3
//        3: The number of comparisons used by algorithm
//        A
//A is
//10
//        10 and that used by
//B
//B is
//19
//        19. Since the number of comparisons used by
//        A
//A is not more than that of
//        B
//B,
//A
//A does not have more time complexity than
//B
//B.
//
//        Test case
//        4
//        4: The number of comparisons used by algorithm
//        A
//A is
//21
//        21 and that used by
//B
//B is
//20
//        20. Since the number of comparisons used by
//        A
//A is more than that of
//        B
//                B,
//                A
//A does have more time complexity than
