//Bull or Bear
//Chef is on his way to become the new big bull of the stock market but is a bit weak at calculating whether he made a profit or a loss on his deal.
//
//Given that Chef bought the stock at value
//X
//X and sold it at value
//Y
//Y. Help him calculate whether he made a profit, loss, or was it a neutral deal.
//
//        Input Format
//The first line of input will contain a single integer
//T
//T, denoting the number of test cases.
//Each test case consists of a single line of input containing two space-separated integers
//X
//X and
//Y
//Y, denoting the value at which Chef bought and sold the stock respectively.
//Output Format
//For each test case, output PROFIT if Chef made a profit on the deal, LOSS if Chef incurred a loss on the deal, and NEUTRAL otherwise.
//
//The checker is case-insensitive so answers like pROfiT, profit, and PROFIT would be considered the same.

//PROFIT
//        LOSS
//Explanation:
//Test case
//        1
//        1: Since the cost price is greater than the selling price, Chef made a loss in the deal.
//
//Test case
//        2
//        2: Since the cost price is equal to the selling price, the deal was neutral.
//
//        Test case
//        3
//        3: Since the cost price is less than the selling price, Chef made a profit in the deal.
//
//Test case
//        4
//        4: Since the cost price is greater than the selling price, Chef made a loss in the deal.
