//Passes for Fair
//There is a fair going on in Chefland. Chef wants to visit the fair along with his
//        N
//N friends. Chef manages to collect
//K
//K passes for the fair. Will Chef be able to enter the fair with all his
//        N
//N friends?
//
//A person can enter the fair using one pass, and each pass can be used by only one person.
//
//Input Format
//The first line of input will contain a single integer
//T
//T, denoting the number of test cases.
//Each test case consists of a single line containing two space-separated integers
//N
//,
//K
//N,K.
//        Output Format
//For each test case, print on a new line YES if Chef will be able to enter the fair with all his
//        N
//N friends and NO otherwise.
//
//You may print each character of the string in either uppercase or lowercase (for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be treated as identical).

//        YES
//Explanation:
//Test case
//        1
//        1: Chef needs
//5
//        5 passes for his friends and one pass for himself and he collected
//8
//        8 passes. Thus he will be able to enter the fair with all his friends.
//
//        Test case
//        2
//        2: Chef needs
//6
//        6 passes for his friends and one pass for himself while he collected only
//3
//        3 passes. Thus he will not be able to enter the fair with all his friends, only three of them can enter the fair.
//
//        Test case
//        3
//        3: Chef needs
//2
//        2 passes for his friends and one pass for himself while he collected only
//2
//        2 passes. Thus either Chef or one of his friends can't enter the fair.
//
//Test case
//        4
//        4: Chef needs a total of
//2
//        2 passes, one for himself and one for his friend. He collected
//2
//        2 passes. Thus he will be able to enter the fair with his friend.
